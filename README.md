Made with Discord.js v14
Uses Node.js

This is a simple discord bot that allows user to add and view "quotes", at any time.
A quote is a screenshot from a conversation. This is to keep track of some funny moments that happened and people enjoy looking back to.
Moderators can also remove quotes.

THIS IS WIP. BOT NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL AT THE MOMENT.

Main code's in src/index.js
